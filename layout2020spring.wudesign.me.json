Clearly, however, it's a different kind of column than the main content column. Style the navigation as if it is what you would see after clicking a typical 'hamburger menu' button on a mobile site or app. As you did with the content itself, think of the style-rules as a system you are creating, rather than one-off instructions for individual parts of the nav. Also, consider how you will organize your stylesheet to clearly separate your nav styles from your content styles.</p><p>At larger page-widths, what worked for mobile will likely start to feel awkward. What approach to styling the navigation makes sense at larger widths? After you have mobile styles working, create one or more media queries that apply new/additional rules to the nav on larger screens. Our goal is to create navigation that makes sense visually regardless of device-context.</p>",
